# Inform7 Parser

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/NekiCat/inform7-parser.svg?branch=master)

This parser is my attempt at parsing the Inform7 language and learn something about parsing along the way. The resulting parser may be used for syntax highlighting, refactoring or linting, for example.
